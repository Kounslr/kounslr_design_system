# Canton Design System

Canton Design System elements and resources for Flutter.

## Description
This package contains elements that I use in my apps. It includes things such as themes (colors, typography, etc.), custom methods, buttons, text-inputs, a color picker, and more. This all in attempt to limit the amount of time I spend on remaking simple tools and ui, while still customizing my screens to my flavor.

## All Features
- _Color system:_ Credits to the Primer Color system, as this is a modified version of theirs.
- _Typography system:_ Credits to the Primer typography system.
- _Buttons:_ Resizable primary button, small/header button and back button with all necessary customizations.
- _Text Inputs:_ Custom text field and text form fields.
- _Borders:_ border customization.
- _Color Picker(WIP):_ Working color picker that returns color.
- _Loading icon:_ Loading icon/widget.
- _Animations(WIP):_ Fluid animations to give a playful but professional feel.
- _Custom Methods:_ Custom methods with ease of use.
- _Icon System:_ Icon system that utilizes Iconly icons, Feather Icons and Cupertino Icons.
- _Light theme:_ Clean light theme.
- _Dark Theme(WIP):_ Clean dark theme with all elements modified.
